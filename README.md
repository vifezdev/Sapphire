# Sapphire java plugin loader
Sapphire is a Java plugin loader that grabs the jars from your desired html website / wherever you store your jars and will load it through memory, It's pretty shit code and I don't even remember if it works because
I stopped coding it before I even got to working on it before i even got to html part because of how shit the code is

# Credits
- Vifez (coded the project)

- You must provide credits while using this project.

# How to setup
- Step 1: Pull the project from github to your IntelliJ
- Step 2: Compile the jar.
- Step 3: Code the HTML and upload your jars
- Step 4: Add some sort of security to prevent your jars from being leaked (I did not work on the security part yet as this project is abandoned)
- Step 5: Add your plugin to loader.yml
- Step 6: Start your server (the plugin should work but I didn't entirely test this)

# READ THIS
I do NOT recommend using this as a security solution for your products as the code is horse shit & there is no security messures,
Although you can use this as a base and add whatever you need to it like security, html jar loading or whatever you need
